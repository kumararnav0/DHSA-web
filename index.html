        <h2>About DHSA</h2>
        <p>
            The Delhi Himachal Students' Association (DHSA) serves as a dynamic bridge between the bustling capital city of Delhi and the serene hills of Himachal Pradesh. Our mission is to unite Himachali students living in Delhi, creating a platform that fosters growth, inclusivity, and collaboration.

            As we bridge the gap between two distinct yet harmonious worlds, we invite every Himachali in Delhi to join hands, explore opportunities, and create lasting memories together. Through our various initiatives and events, we strive to nurture a sense of community and belonging while promoting cultural pride and togetherness.
            
            Join us on this journey of connection and empowerment as we continue to build a vibrant Himachali community in the heart of Delhi.
